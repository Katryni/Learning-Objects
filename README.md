# Learning-Objects

Hello!

This project's name is Repository of Learning Objects, where we find Mathematics contents.
You can use these codes to help you understand something about HTML5, CSS3, a little of JavaScript and PHP, also about the databases like MySQL.
You mustn't copy the codes to change it by your own, remember that this code was developed by someone else and the credits for it isn't yours. The article about this project is already under safety and care of the Federal Institute of Paran√°.

By the way, I hope you enjoy the codes and that this could help you somehow.It's not perfect at all taking into account that it was developed by technical high school students.
